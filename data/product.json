One sold into slavery; one a slave trader's wife. The consequences of their fate reverberate through the generations that follow. Taking us from the Gold Coast of Africa to the cotton-picking plantations of Mississippi; from the missionary schools of Ghana to the dive bars of Harlem, spanning three continents and seven generations, Yaa Gyasi has written a miraculous novel - the intimate, gripping story of a brilliantly vivid cast of characters and through their lives the very story of America itself.\r\n\r\nEpic in its canvas and intimate in its portraits, Homegoing is a searing and profound debut from a masterly new writer.","id":"c8f33b6e-e800-4406-94c5-7ab296b36149"}]
